## Project History
The idea for Study Buddy came from our own experiences as students. We often found ourselves struggling to find study partners who were taking the same course and preparing for the same exams. We realized that there was a need for an application that would make it easy for students to connect with each other and form study groups. So, we decided to create Study Buddy.
